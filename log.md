# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 28th 2024 

**Learning Platform**: Scrimba

**Today's Progress**: Completed (Build & deploy your first website). Created a small personal HTML site.

**Thoughts:** I already know a good bit of HTML and CSS. Much of this course is just a refresher before diving deep into CSS and Javascript.
